<b>Formatting with Markdown</b>

You can format your messages using <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and more! \
Let's learn how to use them.

- <code>*bold*</code>: Asterisks(*) will create <b>bold text</b>.
- <code>_italic_</code>: Underscores(_) will create <i>italic text</i>.
- <code>`code`</code>: Backticks(`) will create <code>monospaced text</code>.
- <code>[hyperlink](google.com)</code>: This will create a hyperlink which links to Google.
- <code>[button](buttonurl://google.com)</code>: This will create a button which links to Google.
If you want multiple buttons on the same row, use <code>:same</code>;
For example:
<code>[1](buttonurl://naver.com)</code>
<code>[2](buttonurl://duckduckgo.com)</code>
<code>[3](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
This will create button 1 on the first row, and button 2 & 3 underneath on the same line.
